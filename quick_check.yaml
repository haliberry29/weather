## Quick last check (so you know it’s perfect)
After starting uvicorn, these should work:

- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/weather?page=1&page_size=3`
- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/weather/stats?page=1&page_size=3`

If you want, paste your current `models.py` and I’ll make sure the `UniqueConstraint` + indexes match exactly what Postgres has (and fix any mismatch cleanly).
